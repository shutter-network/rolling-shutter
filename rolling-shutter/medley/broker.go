// `Broker` allows to distribute a value to multiple
// receiving channels, so that all channels receive the same value.
// This is different to the Fan-Out pattern where multiple channels
// are listening for a send on one channel, but only the first channel
// to select the receive operation receives this value.
//
// The Broker allows to set whether the internal send operation is
// blocking or non blocking. In the blocking case, all receiving
// (subscribed) channels have to successively select the receive in order
// for the broker to continue operation. So if one receiver blocks,
// everything else will block as well.
// In the non-blocking case, a subscribed channel that is blocking
// while the published value is sent will miss the value.
//
// One has to be careful in when to select which case.
// The blocking behavior can be partially subverted by increasing
// the subscribers buffer size - but if a subscriber is blocked forever,
// this will only work until this subscribers buffer is full.
